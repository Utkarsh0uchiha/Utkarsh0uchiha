### Glad to see you here!  
Hello there! My name is Utkarsh, and I am a 16-year-old student with a passion for programming and sports. As a self-taught programmer, I have gained proficiency in several programming languages, including C++, C, Python, and web development languages such as HTML and CSS.

In addition to my technical skills, I also have experience working with Git and Linux, which has allowed me to collaborate on various open-source projects and gain hands-on experience with software development.

When I'm not coding, you can find me playing soccer or Basketball, where I enjoy the physical challenge and the team dynamic. I believe that being a well-rounded individual is just as important as having technical expertise, and sports have taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, and perseverance.

I am excited to continue learning and growing as a programmer and athlete, and I hope to use my skills and experiences to make a positive impact on the world. ‚ô†Ô∏è
